- **KMS** creates and manages encryption keys for a variety of AWS services or for your apps.
- KMS can be used with **CloudTrail** to audit keys access history.
- KMS has the ability to automatically rotate out your keys every year with no need to re-encrypt.
- **Customer Master Keys(CMKs)** are the primary resources in AWS services.
- KMS is a multi-tenant **HSM**, multi tenant means you're sharing the hardware with multiple customers.
- Hardware Security Module(HSM) is a specialized hardware for storing keys and is temper-proof.
- KMS is up to **FIPS 140-2 level 2** compliant.
- KMS stores master keys not data keys.
- Master keys are used to encrypt data keys which is called **Envelop Encryption**
- KMS supports 2 kinds of keys **Symmetric** and **Asymmetric**:
  - **Symmetric** is a single key using 256 bit encryption eg: S3 bucket AES-256
  - **Asymmetric** uses two keys, eg: key pair public and private
- Important KMS APIs to remember:
  - **aws kms create-key**: create a key
  - **aws kms encrypt**: encrypt a key
  - **aws kms decrypt**: decrypt a key
  - **aws kms re-encrypt**: re-encrypt a key
  - **aws kms enable key-rotation**: turn on automatic key rotation(only for **symmetric keys**)
